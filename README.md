# Enhanced Image Retrival system based on Deep JSCC and DHD 

The experiments were conducted using the following software packages:

- Python 3.7.0
- scikit-learn 0.19.2
- scikit-image 0.14.0
- PyTorch 1.13.1 with torchvision 0.14.1 and kornia 0.7.3
- timm 0.4.12
- compressai 1.2.6
- NumPy 1.24.3

The best result could be get from 10dB SNR with 0.06 hyperparameter in new-configured loss.
